HARRINGTON CAPITAL BACKEND - QUICK START GUIDE
==============================================

1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   cd backend
   npm install

2. SET UP ENVIRONMENT:
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Edit .env and change JWT_SECRET to a random string (at least 32 characters)
   - Change ADMIN_PASSWORD if desired

3. INITIALIZE DATABASE:
   npm run init-db

   This creates the database and default admin user:
   Email: admin@harringtoncapital.com
   Password: (whatever you set in .env, default is admin123)

4. START THE SERVER:
   npm run dev    (development with auto-reload)
   OR
   npm start      (production mode)

   Server will run on http://localhost:3000

5. TEST IT:
   - Open the frontend (index.html) in a browser
   - Try logging in with admin credentials
   - The frontend should now connect to the backend API

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get "Cannot find module" errors, run "npm install" again
- If port 3000 is in use, change PORT in .env
- If database errors, delete backend/data/ folder and run "npm run init-db" again

NOTE: The frontend (index.html) has been updated to use the API, but you may need
to update portal.js and admin.js to fully replace localStorage with API calls.
